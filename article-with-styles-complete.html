<h2>World in shock as former chat show host pledges prizes for all citizens</h2>
<p>The world has woken up to the shock news that Oprah Winfrey has been elected President of the United States. President Winfrey has pledged to give everyone a free car, in a nod to her own prize giveaways on her chat show. She's also promised to shake things up at the White House where she will host a weekly chat show with celebrities. Her new show will be streamed live on Netflix every Saturday night, with some descibing it as a downmarket, less political version of The View.</p>
